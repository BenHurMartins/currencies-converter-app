## Currencies Converter

Hi, this app allows to convert from/to several currencies, also from crypto currencies to standart currencies.

The second feature that I choose for this challenge was the one to convert from Crypto.

The app allows us to change the language (English and Portuguese).

About the sugested api, I don't think that was a good option, the free plan was a bit limited, so i choose another one, as allowed by the challenge (api.frankfurter.app), this api doesn't have the same quantity of currencies as the sugested, but it has the main currencies in the world with unlimited fetches, ideal for this challenge.

For a next feature, I would implement the option to swipe the the from/to currencies, allowing to the user easily exchange between them.
